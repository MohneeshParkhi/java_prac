1. This interface is used to sort the custom objects on the basis of only one
field.

2. To work with this Custom object must implement the Comparable interface and implements 
it  compareTo() method, that returns values on the basis of if considtions 

Values are : 

a) if Object are equal, return 0
b) First object is greater thjan 2, return 1
c) First Object is smaller than return -1.

3. It is part of java.lang.* package and introduced in JAVA 1.2 

4. By Default, String Class and all the wrapper class implements the Comparable Class
So, we can drectly use Collections.sort() method to appli sorting on objects.
