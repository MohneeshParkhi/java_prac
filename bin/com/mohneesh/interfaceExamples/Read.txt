Changes in the JAVA version 8/9/10/11

### Version 8 brought two drastic change in definition of interface.
a) static 
b) default 

## static and default are two keywords used in the methods definition.

Qus: Why these two keyword used in method definition:
Ans: 
   1.  Static:
        * static keyword is used to give a default definition to methods of interface,
        can be used with definition and cannot change it.
        * Used for factory method pattern design to take object of particular type.
        * Can be used to perform task like database based lyk fetching connection,
          writing code for utility function.
        
        Default keyword:
        
        * Can be used with same purpose as discussed above
        
      Note: Both keywords are introduced in the java language version 8 to provide key
            features:
