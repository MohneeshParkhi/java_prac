Points to remember about JAVA Constructor :

a) Constructor are special methods used to instantiate the Objects.
b) There can be Private, Protected, Public and Default Constructors.
c) Private Constructor cannot be Invoked outside the current class.
d) If return type is added to constructor signature, It get
converted into  method, does not remain constructor.

e) Constructor can be parameterized, so can be used to initialize the
value of reference variables in class.

f) constructor can be used to create objects of different classes.


Case 1:

If a class extends another class having protected, public type
constructor, then we have to define explicitly constructor of super
type.
