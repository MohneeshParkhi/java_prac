Some points about ArrayList:

1. ArrayList is the collection representation of Array dataStructure.
2. As Manipulation is costly in terms of time and space complexity, it is also in arrayList collection.
3. Mainpulation requires shifting of elements.
4. Not thread safe
5.  maintain insertion order.
6. Contain duplicate elements.
7. Random access duew to index based access.

TimeComplexity to search algorithm :

 a) Best Case : O(1)
 b) Worst Case : O(n)
